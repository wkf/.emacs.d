ace-window

    C-t
        a w? select (enable always select mode temporarily?)
        v vsplit
        h hsplit
        y copy
        d delete

        ? help

** ivy

     - [X] C-return action with ace window select
     - [X] add actions for v and h splitting
     - [X] open in other window (move cursor)
     - [X] open in other window (don't move cursor)
     - [X] remap C-return back to ivy-dispatching read

    rather than having a bunch of different ace-window commands, use open other window when there's only one window,
    and then use t/T when there's more than one window

        if 1 window, split window sensibly
        if 2+ windows, use ace-window

** eshell

     C-return run command with ace window select

** treemacs

     C-return open file with ace window select
