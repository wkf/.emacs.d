* Code

A restclient example so I don't forget.

#+begin_src restclient
GET https://gnu.org/software/emacs
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
#+end_src

An attempt at locking down how new windows open, didn't work that well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq display-buffer-alist '((".*" (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-same-window)))
      display-buffer-reuse-frames t
      even-window-sizes nil)
#+end_src

Make certain commands run in a term instead of eshell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "npm")
(add-to-list 'eshell-visual-subcommands '("npm" "test"))
#+end_src

Open README.org for emacs.d project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
